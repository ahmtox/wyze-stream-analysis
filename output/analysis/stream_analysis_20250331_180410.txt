The image shows a large, imposing white bunny rabbit standing in a forest clearing. The bunny has an intimidating, almost angry facial expression as it looks directly at the camera. A small, gray mouse sits timidly next to the bunny's foot, emphasizing the massive size difference between the two animals. The forest background is lush and green, with grass, trees and a cloudy sky visible. The scene has a somewhat fantastical or surreal quality to it, given the unusually large scale of the bunny compared to its natural surroundings and the mouse.

Based on the image, it appears several people are doing jumping jacks or a similar calisthenic exercise in an open grassy field near a residential area. A person can be seen standing with their arms and legs spread, which is the typical jumping jack position. Some children are also sitting on the porch or deck of the nearby house, watching the people exercising outdoors.
